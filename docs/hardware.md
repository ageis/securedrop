## Notice: Documentation Moved

**New documentation:** https://docs.securedrop.org

If you are viewing this file on GitHub in your web browser, you are using an
outdated link to the SecureDrop documentation. The new and improved
documentation is available at https://docs.securedrop.org.

This document (the Hardware Guide) has been moved to
https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/hardware.html.

This document is a temporary placeholder to help redirect users who still have
links to the old-style SecureDrop documentation hosted on GitHub. Please update
your bookmarks. If you came here from another website, please [file an issue][]
so we can follow up with the website maintainer.

Finally, note that this placeholder will eventually be removed, and that
removal may happen without warning and at any time.
