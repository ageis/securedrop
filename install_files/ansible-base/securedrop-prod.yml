  # If the OSSEC authd iptables rule exemptions are in place remove them and

  # the authd role, in order to allow all agents to connect to the ossec server
  # before killing authd and removing the ossec rules. This is a separate role for
  # the ossec server. The order of events does matter: the monitor server authd
  # service needs to be listening and reachable, then agent needs to connect to
  # ossec server, agent needs to restart, then ossec server exemptions can be
  # removed and the ossec server process can restart.
